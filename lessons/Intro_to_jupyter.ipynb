    "# An introduction to Jupyter notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook (formally iPython) is an interactive environment for Python, and it's probably the best way of using Python for data manipulation.  You may ask: \"I can just run python interactively from the terminal, why do I need jupyter?\"  Well, that's a fair question, and the answer will hopefully become clear as we work through this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are broken down into **cells**.  We're in the topmost cell of this notbook at the moment.  Cells come in three flavors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Markdown cells** allows you to edit the text in Markdown.  These cells are used for exposition, discussion, and general formatting.  Think of them as extended comments that can be formatted beautifully, and can contain [links](http://www.jupyter.org), bulleted lists, etc.  Anything that Markdown can!  It even allows for LaTeX:\n",
    "$$\\int_{1}^{\\sqrt[3]{3}} cos_i(4x-1)$$\n",
    "* **Code cells** contain code (for us, Python code).  These cells can contain code as short as one line, or as long as you'd like!  (Actually, I have no idea what the maximum length is.  I've had cells well over 100 lines long though).  They have some basic text editor support, so they'll help you with indentation, tab completion, etc., but they won't be able to do some of the magic that true editors like Atom or Sublime can handle.  They're also interactive in the same way that the Python interpretter in interactive mode is.  Type `15*4 %3` and it returns the answer, no need to `print` out everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one more, but it's not used as often:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Raw cells** are used when you want to hack the notebook to make it fancier.  We won't be using them tons, but it's good to know they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you're running into any unexpected errors while working through this notebook, contact Dr Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "How about a little demonstation?  Run the code cell below with `shift + enter`"

    "\n",
    "While working with a notebook, you are always in one of two modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In **Edit mode** you can edit the content of a cell.  You're in edit mode in a cell when the left border of the cell is green.  It acts like a text file inside a text editor, and has some helpful syntax highlighting.  If you're editing a Markdown cell, it will look significantly different.  If you're editing a code cell, it will look mostly the same.  To *run* the cell, you have a few options:\n",
    " * press `command + enter` or `ctrl + enter` to run the cell and exit edit mode.  Running a markdown cell will render it, and running a code cell performs as you expect.\n",
    " * press `shift + enter` to run the cell and insert a new cell below.  This is the standard command when you're building the notebook.\n",
    "1. In **Command mode** you have access to your cells in a larger-scale way.  You're in command mode on a cell when the left border of the cell is blue.  You can press `up` or `down` to move between cells, and press `enter` to enter edit mode on the currently selected cells.  You can also cut, copy, paste, and delete cells with appropriate keyboard commands.  Open the *Command Palette* (the keyboard in the top center of the toolbar) to see all the commands you can use in Command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linearity of code: the kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook has a **kernel** attached to it.  Think of it as the interactive python interpreter running behind the scenes, executing your commands when you send them.  There are two forms of \"linearity\" (or temporal/time state) going on here, and it can be a bit confusing to new Jupyter users:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Kernel Linearity**: After you execute a code cell, it gives you its output and places a number next to the top of the cell.  This number is the *order of cell execution* in the kernel.  It's the order the kernel is receiving.  This means you can run cells, tweak them and run them again, run something \"below\" the cell in the notebook, then come back and run the upper cell, *etc.*, and the kernel will keep track of this in terms of the order in which you ran them **chronologically**.  This is the order you want to keep in mind.  It's really useful!  You can start out with a junky-looking notebook, figure out your data analysis, realize you want to change stuff \"in the past\", and just go back and change them.  Once you get used to this, you'll love it.\n",
    "* **Cell Linearity**: There is an obvious order to the cells: the top ones \"go first\", and the lower ones \"go next\".  This isn't exactly necessary, though.  It definitely is the goal of the *final product* to go linearly, but programming, and especially data analysis, isn't like reading an essay.  Very often, you'll need to go back and change things, then rerun all the cells that come after the one you just edited.  You may type one line in a cell, hit `shift + enter` to see the output and move on to the next cell, then do that three more times.  You then realize that you'd prefer to have done all that at once, and you can merge those three cells together.  It's a workflow that I hope you'll learn to love.\n",
    "\n",
    "Play around with it now: use an uninitialized variable `my_hat` in a cell, then hit `esc` to leave the cell without running (or hit `shift + enter` to see the error.  Below that, create a cell in which you give the variable a value, then run that cell, followed by the original cell: "
